IMAGE_REL_BASED_ABSOLUTE
0
The base relocation is skipped. This type can be used to pad a block.
IMAGE_REL_BASED_HIGH
1
The base relocation adds the high 16 bits of the difference to the 16-bit field at offset. The 16-bit field represents the high value of a 32-bit word.
IMAGE_REL_BASED_LOW
2
The base relocation adds the low 16 bits of the difference to the 16-bit field at offset. The 16-bit field represents the low half of a 32-bit word.
IMAGE_REL_BASED_HIGHLOW
3
The base relocation applies all 32 bits of the difference to the 32-bit field at offset.
IMAGE_REL_BASED_HIGHADJ
4
The base relocation adds the high 16 bits of the difference to the 16-bit field at offset. The 16-bit field represents the high value of a 32-bit word. The low 16 bits of the 32-bit value are stored in the 16-bit word that follows this base relocation. This means that this base relocation occupies two slots.
IMAGE_REL_BASED_MIPS_JMPADDR
5
The relocation interpretation is dependent on the machine type. When the machine type is MIPS, the base relocation applies to a MIPS jump instruction.
IMAGE_REL_BASED_ARM_MOV32
5
This relocation is meaningful only when the machine type is ARM or Thumb. The base relocation applies the 32-bit address of a symbol across a consecutive MOVW/MOVT instruction pair.
IMAGE_REL_BASED_RISCV_HIGH20
5
This relocation is only meaningful when the machine type is RISC-V. The base relocation applies to the high 20 bits of a 32-bit absolute address.
RESERVED
6
Reserved, must be zero.
IMAGE_REL_BASED_THUMB_MOV32
7
This relocation is meaningful only when the machine type is Thumb. The base relocation applies the 32-bit address of a symbol to a consecutive MOVW/MOVT instruction pair.
IMAGE_REL_BASED_RISCV_LOW12I
7
This relocation is only meaningful when the machine type is RISC-V. The base relocation applies to the low 12 bits of a 32-bit absolute address formed in RISC-V I-type instruction format.
IMAGE_REL_BASED_RISCV_LOW12S
8
This relocation is only meaningful when the machine type is RISC-V. The base relocation applies to the low 12 bits of a 32-bit absolute address formed in RISC-V S-type instruction format.
IMAGE_REL_BASED_LOONGARCH32_MARK_LA
8
This relocation is only meaningful when the machine type is LoongArch 32-bit. The base relocation applies to a 32-bit absolute address formed in two consecutive instructions.
IMAGE_REL_BASED_LOONGARCH64_MARK_LA
8
This relocation is only meaningful when the machine type is LoongArch 64-bit. The base relocation applies to a 64-bit absolute address formed in four consecutive instructions.
IMAGE_REL_BASED_MIPS_JMPADDR16
9
The relocation is only meaningful when the machine type is MIPS. The base relocation applies to a MIPS16 jump instruction.
IMAGE_REL_BASED_DIR64
10
The base relocation applies the difference to the 64-bit field at offset.
